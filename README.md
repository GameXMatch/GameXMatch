## Information about GameXMatch

GameXMatch is a mobile app that lets you search for your brother/sister in arms for multiplayer and co-op games.
The purpose is to match with a player that has the same games/interests/skill level as you and therefore removing the frustation and long waiting hours spend by finding a player that fits you.
